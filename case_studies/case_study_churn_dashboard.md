Case Study: Executive Performance Dashboard for Program Retention Improvement
1. Problem

A new outbound engagement program was launched to expand outreach to underserved and hard-to-reach customer segments. Although early acquisition numbers were strong, retention dropped sharply—nearly 90% of new customers discontinued the service within three months.
Leadership needed a clear understanding of why this pattern occurred and how to intervene quickly. The existing reporting tools lacked visibility into post-acquisition behavior, operational risks, and the drivers of churn.

2. My Role

I served as the project lead from discovery to deployment.
My responsibilities included:

Partnering with cross-functional stakeholders to define analytical needs and performance indicators

Designing a rapid-turn operational report for early insights

Developing a scalable executive-level Power BI dashboard consolidating all analytical work

Translating findings into actionable metrics for senior leadership decision-making

3. Approach
Data Preparation

Queried and integrated disparate data sources using SQL and cleansed the dataset in Python

Applied data quality checks to ensure reliability while reducing noise

Analytical Modeling

Conducted a regression-based analysis to identify key predictors of churn, weighting each factor’s impact

Validated findings through iterative discussions with business stakeholders

Dashboard & Metric Design

Designed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard focused on:

Acquisition funnel performance

Retention curves and drop-off points

Newly derived churn-risk indicators

Program-level comparison against organizational benchmarks

Ensured the dashboard was highly intuitive, executive-friendly, and refreshed automatically in production.

4. Outcome

The analysis and dashboard directly informed operational and strategic adjustments, resulting in:

Major retention improvement: churn dropped from nearly 90% at Month 3 to below the organization’s average, signaling a complete program turnaround.

Adoption across departments: new churn-risk metrics were incorporated into other sales and outreach programs, reducing exposure to retention issues driven by promotions and discounts.

Leadership empowerment: executives gained ongoing visibility into program performance and could make rapid, data-driven decisions instead of relying on static ad-hoc reports.

5. Lessons & Lasting Impact

The dashboard remains active in production and has been enhanced over time to support broader organizational needs. It is now used not only by the operational team but also by Marketing, Finance, and Program Strategy as a core tool for performance monitoring, forecasting, and risk mitigation.

This project strengthened:

My ability to lead cross-functional analytics initiatives

My experience designing executive-ready BI products

My approach to building scalable metrics that influence enterprise-wide strategy
